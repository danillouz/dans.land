Sending small packets has a large overhead that can cause network congestion.

For example, sending 1 byte of data over the network results in a 41 bytes packet (20 bytes for TCP and 20 bytes for IPv4 headers).

This is called the "small-packet problem" and for example happens in telnet sessions, where every single character is sent over the network as it's typed.

Especially over a slow network, sending many small packets like that can lead to network congestion.

## Solving the small-packet problem

Nagle's algorithm solves the small-packet problem by essentially delaying (and buffering) the sending of packets to improve bandwidth efficiency and throughput.

The algorithm can be described as:

1. If the sender has unacknowledged data, buffer new application data.
2. Send it when the outstanding data is acknowledged, or when enough data is available for a full-sized segment.

This is sometimes called "nagling" and is usually _enabled_ by default.

## ACK delays

A different solution for the same problem is to use ACK delays.

ACK delays combine several ACK responses into a single one, by waiting for a short period that varies by implementation (e.g. 200 ms).

This way it can either:

- Combine multiple ACKs.
- Include the ACK in data it needs to send anyways (this is called "piggybacking").

ACK delays are usually _also_ enabled by default.

## Nagle's algorithm and ACK delays

Nagle's algorithm can interact badly with delayed ACKs.
When both are enabled, a small write can wait for an ACK or for enough data to fill a segment, while the ACK itself is delayed.

This becomes problematic for latency-sensitive applications.

## Disabling Nagle's algorithm

For most modern (latency-sensitive) applications Nagle's algorithm should be disabled.
As it's not common to send single byte data like in the telnet days and you most likely want to send data as soon as possible.

But it depends on the use case: disabling Nagle can reduce latency, but can also increase the number of small packets

For example, Go considers disabling Nagle's algorithm to be a sane default: [pkg.go.dev/net#TCPConn.SetNoDelay](https://pkg.go.dev/net#TCPConn.SetNoDelay).
